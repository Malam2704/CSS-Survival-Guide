                <h2>Chapter 5: CSS Layout</h2>
                <p>Elements on web pages are laid out according to normal flow unless otherwise specified.  Normal flow is the manner in which elements are displayed on a page before any adjustments are made to their layout. </p>
                <p>Recall from HTML that there are two types of elements: inline and block.  Inline elements do not have a new line after them.  Examples include &lt;a&gt; and &lt;img&gt.  Block elements have a new line after them without the need for a &lt;br&gt; tag.  Examples include headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.  By default, a block level element has a width that is 100% of the width of its parent element and a height tall enough for its content.</p>
                <p>When targeting specific elements with CSS, consider using the &lt;span&gt; tag, an inline container, or the &lt;div&gt; tag, a block container.  Both tags can be given an ID or class name, which can then be styled.</p>
                <p>For Example,</p>
                    <!-- insert example here -->
                <p>The upcoming chapters will discuss properties that will allow for the alteration of the default page layout.</p>
