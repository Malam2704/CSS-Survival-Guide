                <h2>Chapter 9: Pseudo-Classes</h2>
                <p>A pseudo-class can be used to specify a particular state of an element.  The generic format of pseudo-classes is:</p>
                <p>
                    selector:pseudo-class { <br/>
                        &nbsp;property: value; <br/>
                    }
                </p>
                <p>Anchor pseudo-classes are some of the most useful and can be applied to links and their various states of unvisited, visited, hovered, and active.  Styling links is really just a love/hate relationship.  The link pseudo-classes and the order in which to include them in CSS (top to bottom) can be remembered using the mnemonic “LoVe HAte” (LVHA = link, visited, hover, active):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a:link – to style an unvisited link</li>
                        <li>a:visited – to style a visited link</li>
                        <li>a:hover – to style a link that is being hovered or moused over</li>
                        <li>a:active – to style a link that is actively being clicked</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>For Example,</p>
                    <!-- insert example here -->
